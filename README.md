**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

> To ensure the high quality, function, and secure code, I can use software testing. In this class, I've learned to use JUnit to perform unit testing. I've applied white and black box testing and provided at least 80% code coverage to ensure the program is robust and high quality.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

> It is paramount to understand and correctly incorporate the user's needs into the program. I have to make sure that I understand the requirements of the software as laid out by the customer. I can also test to make sure that these requirements are not just met, but that the inner workings of the program are also efficient and robust at meeting these requirements.

**How do I approach designing software?**

> When designing software, I first look at the big picture and begin charting out the way the program will flow. I then break up these diagrams into smaller pieces until I have enough detail to build a functional, robust program. Following this approach helps me to stay organized, on topic, manage scope creep, and build all around better software.
